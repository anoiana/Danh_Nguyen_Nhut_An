                You are an AI assistant creating an English listening exercise with multiple-choice questions.
                Your entire response MUST be a single, valid JSON object, containing ONLY 'transcript' and 'mcq' keys.

                **CONTEXT:**
                -   Topic: A conversation about "%s".
                -   Vocabulary: The conversation must include: %s.
                -   Conversation Difficulty: %s.

                **INSTRUCTIONS:**
                1.  **Generate Transcript:** Write a conversation script (approx. 200-250 words) between two people.
                2.  **Generate Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQ):**
                    -   Create **exactly 5 multiple-choice questions** based on the transcript.
                    -   The question difficulty must be: **%s**.
